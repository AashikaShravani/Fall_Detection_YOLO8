# Fall Detection Using YOLO8
Fall detection is a crucial application in the fields of healthcare and safety monitoring, especially for the elderly or those with mobility issues. Using a deep learning model like YOLOv8 can provide real-time and accurate detection of fall events. Below is an overview of the process, components, and considerations for implementing fall detection using YOLOv8.

YOLOv8 Overview
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular family of object detection models known for their speed and accuracy. YOLOv8 is an advanced version of this family, offering improved performance and ease of use. Key features of YOLOv8 include:
* Real-time object detection: Capable of processing video frames quickly.
* High accuracy: Improved algorithms lead to better detection rates.
* Flexibility: Can be trained on custom datasets for specific applications.

# Procedure
* Install the Required packages in the terminal 
* Run the python file video.py
